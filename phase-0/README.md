This project directory is intended to give a "Hello, World"-style warm-up and
introduction to the build system and project layout we recommend for MercuryDB
projects.

In this project we create a basic class, Person, in Person.java, in a package
for table schemas, and a single file, Main.java, which runs the main application
logic.

We don't use any notable features of MercuryDB, but this is a good opportunity
to explore what a MercuryDB project looks like, and also explore the kinds of
build artifacts that are produced when you run the build.
