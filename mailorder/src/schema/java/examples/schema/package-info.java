 * object references, collections, and inheritance. To the extent
 * that it is consistent with the goals and design of a traditional
 * database schema, we will leverage the features of HgDB to create the
 * best possible code to reflect the schema we present in this example.

 * <p>
 * Comments will be included to justify the code where it seems helpful
 * to explain features of HgDB.
